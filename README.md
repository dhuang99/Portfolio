## About The Project
I was initially inspired to create a website when I was watching a Devlog from one of my favorite game developers. This inspired me to spend a bit of time to create my own personal website portfolio that would show off my creativity and coding skills. And so, I self-learned HTML, CSS, and a bit of Javascript to produce this website.


## Usage
You can currently view my website at <a href="danielhuang99.com">danielhuang99.com</a>.

## Road Map
There are many parts of my website that I know that I can improve. In addition, there are so many HTML, CSS, and JavaScript functions that I have not explored.

### Known Issues
* Some of the pages are not responsive to screen size

### Proposed Features
I've thought of a few features to add to the website in the future:
* A skills bar section
* Animated GIFs of my projects
* More aesthetically pleasing pictures/icons
